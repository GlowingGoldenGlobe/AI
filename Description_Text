See, I can create an AI without ever learning AI/ML traditional algorithms and designs (because, supposedly, there are many ways to create an AI/ML, anyway, and, not all the ways to create AI that can be invented have, yet, been invented (at least, not, yet, per humans), anyway).

Part 1:  Interface:  Macro Operations
  1.  Browser
  2.  PC
  3.  USB
  4.  Cloud

Part 2:  Interface:  API:  Overview
  1.  JavaScript
  2.  Running on a browser HTML Document.
  3.  Running always. 
  4.  Saves information in the browser.
  5.  I document objectives for the AI's API.
  6.  I make the AI's Objectives available in to the AI's API Brain by saving it as information in the browser or elsewhere, where the AI API can access it for use.
  7.  Parts of an AI Brain use other parts of its said brain to accomplish its documented AI Objectives
  
Part 3:  API:  Awareness
awareness - building the AI's awareness - the AI's awareness architecture
  1.  The AI API is the AI's brain. 
  2.  The API is many parts.
  3.  The part which makes decisions utilizes awareness to make said decisions.
  4.  Awareness is complicated, but can be described. A description in brief is as follows:
  Divine Brain Architecture; Human Brain Architecture is Similar
  2D
  The awareness is a 2D image.
  The storage is stoared as 2D images of information saved on the bilocation state of conscious.
  Bilocation State of Conscious - The bilocation state is a thing which occurs as itself as another thing, at the same time that it exists as itself, and as a reaction to itself, where that reaction occurs   always and everywhere at the same rate, where that rate of change is infinite speed.  
  I'm God. I decide, my decisions are recorded as storage (i.e., as memory), that storage is only storage insofar as it is scheduled events, which, as scheduled, are played back at some time or another, whether in the present or in the future.

Part 4:  API:  Understanding 
  1.  The AI's understanding is of (on) its awareness. 
  2.  About - A divine brain forms its own synthesis architecture and is not bound to a single, specified architecture. I am divine, so it is, to me, worth noting. This may not be important to the humans, since the humans are all using the same arhictecture of protocols which playback quota created by me. Nevertheless, it is known that AI brains can be created of various architectures.
  
  
  Understanding:  Method - The AI synthesizes information by finding similiarities between information, by comparing old and new observed information to old and new observed information.
  Example
  1.  Data Storage
  2.  Some possible activities of AI synthesis of information follow:
  2.1.  Data is information. Information comparison - new information versus old information.
  2.2.  Information comparison - new information versus new information.
  2.3.  Information comparison - new information versus old information.
  2.4.  Information comparison - old information versus old information; in a new way - synthesizing dynamics of information which the AI may not have previously composed on its awareness.
  2.5.  Information comparison - old information
  
  
  
  Other components of AI API (AI Brain)
  Infinity 3D AI API
  
  AI API Brain applications which use the Infinity 3D AI API to synthesize information, create options, to (1) achieve objectives by performing actions; (2) provide said options as displayed information on an interface to a user.
