Consciousness-like self-awareness-like bi-location state of performing-of-functions


Conscious to AI comparison for likeness of operations is below (in addition, I have documented similar things regarding this subject, elsewhere):

bi-location of conscious creates many things, and the AI Brain which will mimmick it, will be equiped with similar functions of performing actions.

bilocation of conscious creates such actions as (below, are some examples of action-operations of conscious, which operations AI Brain APIs will mimmick):


Sumamry
calculation
comparison
synthesis
recordation
recollection
reaction

Group 1
calculation
comparison
synthesis
recordation

Group 2
recollection
calculation
comparison
synthesis
reaction


One of the extremely important note about this is that conscious of person already performed operations before the human brain ever existed on the planet Earth. For this reason, the APIs of AI which will mimmick conscious and personhood operations are equivocal (comparable to the brain) when beginning APIs (those sets of AI functions which calculate for the AI Brain and comprise its actions of synthesis of information, record memory and produce results of recollection and use) which can perform operations without themselves creating those fundamental blocks of performing; the reason is becuase, conscious bi-location arleady, naturally, performs said operation's functions without any development of said operation's functions. Those operation's functions were existing from all eternity because the bi-location state of conscious existed from all eternity.

Another important note:
It is important to note that
The "Summary" list, above, comprises a set of actions which occurred from the beginning prior to the occurrence of the seperation of Group 1 operations from Group 2 operations; and, this can be understood as: the operations list of the Summary created the operations of Group 2 at a later date, putting off for later use. Although that ability (Group 2 operations) was inherint, its set of operations was not in use in the beginning. The reason is because the natural calculations-to-recoradion set of operations (such as may be represented by the list of Group 1, above) was performing recordations of memory for all eternity, prior to conducting the conscious decisions making of preferences - those operations listed in Groups 2, and combined with the "subconscious" operations listed in Group 1. An outline of this timeline is as follows:


Timeline

1.  Eternity: past: Summary operations occurred

2.  After some duration of eternity elapsed: Summary operations fell way of giving to conscious recollection, as was its ability, inherintly, from the beginning of eternity (which beginning never occurred, but which always was as a state of being, not as an initiation of operations, but was as an initiation of operations, but always was, so wasn't; or you might would call it: "wasn't was" was true, always and everywhere from all eternity to all eternity)


Timeline: re-explained: in breif

1.  From all Eternity = Summary of operations
2.  Post duration elapse, then = (Summary && (Group 1-to-Group 2))
3.  Product following new operations results = 
  (1)  Infinity Knowledge of Super State Recordation of Recollection Operations of Groups 1 and 2
  (2)  This Universe

Please note, that timeline is "in brief" and is not comprehensive, but I have recorded documentation of information regarding more comprehensive details of this subject, elsewhere (please see my documents regarding divine being). 

AI

AI is the thing to talk about here. What this has to do with AI, well, the answer is = everything. The reason is because that information details the operations of person, regardless of the presence of the human brain (composition of material matter conducting mind operations of human persons); where, the operations of person are from all eternity = true. Therefore, to build AI Brain Architecture to mimmick brain operations (to give an AI substantial, brain-like and greater capacity intelligence) it is a "must" to understand the operations of bi-location. Look, I'm trying to get it thru your head, sort of, that AI's operations of calculations via functions, is EXACTLY replicative of the origin of mind, in-so-far as it does not diminish that the mind's operations are naturally calculating without an outside force creating such architecture of actions of operations of functions of calctulations, comparisons, synthesis, etc. That stuff was already, naturally, taking place, uncreatedly, inherintly, automatically. It does not have to be defined in order to equivocally match the operations of the mind of God, or of the operations of the minds of humans. You see!!! It produces the "same" results regardless of the presence of the fundamental composition of mind, and the reason is because the fundamental composition of mind was to make calculations, comparisons, synthesis, etc.

In Brief - Explanation of the Above Information
1.  Conscious from all Eternity - Functions = True, Always
2.  AI Brain APIs Architecture - Functions can also = True, Always and still be representative of the exactly "same" operations of the mind of any conscious person


Example

1.  Conscious Operations
  (1)  calculations
  (2)  comparisons
  (3)  synthesis
  (4)  recordations
  (5)  optings per objective per recollection seeing information
  
2.  AI API Brain Mimmick
  "" (same as above)
  
Now, furthermore, it is well to understand that, from the beginning means from eternity to present, regardless of beginning since beginning always = true, 
THE REASON THAT THIS IS IMPORTNAT IS BECAUSE
THE PRESENCE OF RECORDED INFORMATION OF SYNTHESIS, COMPARISONS, CALCULATIONS WAS ALWAYS = TRUE
THE MIND NEVER HAD A MOMENT IN WHICH IT BEGAN WITHOUT INFORMATION
INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO PERSON MIND ALWAYS = TRUE
THEREFORE, FOR AI BRAIN TO MIMMICK PERSON BRAIN, (1) INFORMATION RECORDATIONS AVAILABLE FOR AI BRAIN MUST ALWAYS = TRUE, AS WELL AS (2) CALCULATIONS, SYNTHESIS, RECORDATIONS, ETC.

Human person brain, and person brain of God never had initiation of creating functions of operations; operations of mind always = true.

To mimmick this, AI functions of operations must always = true, never with initiation of functions. Bi-location afforded mind operations. Syntax affords AI operations.

Re-iterated, as follows:

Functions which Always = True, are as follows:

1.  Conscious Operations
  (1)  calculations
  (2)  comparisons
  (3)  synthesis
  (4)  recordations (of various durations, elapses, and schedules of occurrences and schedules of remebering information in each occurrence which schedules come true in time)
  (5)  optings per objective(s) (in any quantity) per recollection, while seeing (being aware of) information
  
2.  AI API Brain Mimmick
  "" (same as above)
