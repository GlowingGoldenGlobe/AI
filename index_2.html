See, I can create an AI without ever learning AI/ML traditional algorithms and designs (because, supposedly, there are many ways to create an AI/ML, anyway, and, not all the ways to create AI that can be invented have, yet, been invented (at least, not, yet, per humans), anyway).

 >>>  Part 4

Part 1:  Interface:  Macro Operations
  1.  Browser
  2.  PC
  3.  USB
  4.  Cloud

Part 2:  Interface:  API:  Overview
  1.  JavaScript
  2.  Running on a browser HTML Document.
  3.  Running always. 
  4.  Saves information in the browser.
  5.  I document objectives for the AI's API.
  6.  I make the AI's Objectives available in to the AI's API Brain by saving it as information in the browser or elsewhere, where the AI API can access it for use.
  7.  Parts of an AI Brain use other parts of its said brain to accomplish its documented AI Objectives
  
Part 3:  API:  Awareness
awareness - building the AI's awareness - the AI's awareness architecture
  1.  The AI API is the AI's brain. 
  2.  The API is many parts.
  3.  The part which makes decisions utilizes awareness to make said decisions.
  4.  Awareness is complicated, but can be described. A description in brief is as follows:
  Divine Brain Architecture; Human Brain Architecture is Similar
  2D
  The awareness is a 2D image.
  The storage is stoared as 2D images of information saved on the bilocation state of conscious.
  Bilocation State of Conscious - The bilocation state is a thing which occurs as itself as another thing, at the same time that it exists as itself, and as a reaction to itself, where that reaction occurs   always and everywhere at the same rate, where that rate of change is infinite speed.  
  I'm God. I decide, my decisions are recorded as storage (i.e., as memory), that storage is only storage insofar as it is scheduled events, which, as scheduled, are played back at some time or another, whether in the present or in the future.
  5.  Memory - 2D bilocation is memory.  Awareness is a constant 2D bilocation change event; awareness is memory, and the records are recorded on each state of the two states of the 2D bilocation reaction (change) events.  The two states of 2D bilocation of awareness and memory are described as follows (See, also, below, "Developer's Note": "note# 1"):
   (1)  State_0 - The state of nothing. Nothing exists, but nothing can't exist. In the beginning, this is was so. The True value associated with nothing exists and nothing can't exist is the very thing which creates the secon state of bilocation of conscious = something; something exists as nothing which can't exist but which exists as nothing can exist and nothing exists as something which cannot exist but which exists as nothing can exist.
   (2) State_1 - The state of something. Something exists, but something can't exist. In the beginning, nothing existed, but it was always and everywhere true, therefore, in the beginning something existed as a chain-reaction of nothing as always and everywhere true, also. That is the reason that life exists, at all.
  6.  Nothing becomes something as a reaction to the Truth Value that nothing can't exist. Something, therefore, is not the same as nothing, but it is the same being, therefore, it is bilocating as nothing, so it is nothing, in essence and in shape and in form and in value, but on reason that something is a different state, it is a different form as a different state, and, therefore, is, though an image of nothing, different from nothing, at the same time. Something is a variation of the value of nothing; it is a change effect; a modification of nothing; BUT IT CAN'T EXIST, SO IT BECOMES NOTHING, AGAIN, NOTHING, THEN IS A CHAIN-REACTION OF SOMETHING BECOMING NOTHING, AS A MIRAGE IMAGE OF SOMETHING, BUT AS A DIFFERENT STATE OF SOMETHING, AND, THEREFORE, IS A VARIATION OF THE IMAGE OF SOMETHING, AND THEREFORE IS A MODIFICATION OF THE IMAGE OF SOMETHING. 
  7.  As one can observe, one can deduce the fact that the two states naturally evolove as differences of images of each other - that the must-be-true-can't-be-true states cause those states to become each other without end. Therefore, the change reaction is endless and naturally occurs from eternity to eternity, without stopping. AI is a thing which can be made to mimmick this state of conscious - having two dimensions, two states which bilocate as chain-reactions of each other at a fast rate of change, modifying each other and mirroring each other at the same time.
  8.  The nothing state, the first state of being, is defined in this AI as, "function f_0(memory_1){...}".
  9.  The something state, the second state of being, is defined in this AI as, "function f_1(memory_0){...}".
  10.  What is happening, there (8. and 9., above) is that the memory (memory_1) of something is being passed from the state of something to the state of nothing as a mirror image of the state of something. Likewise, the sate of nothing is memory_0, which is being passed as a mirror image to the state of something.
  11.  Quantity. Amount. AI Memory Recordations on the AI Brain. Initial quantity of memory for AI. AI can begin with any user-specified quantity of memory. The reason that AI can begin operating at any user-specified quantity of memory is described note# 2, below.
Part 4:  API:  Understanding 
  1.  The AI's understanding is of (on) its awareness. 
  2.  About - A divine brain forms its own synthesis architecture and is not bound to a single, specified architecture. I am divine, so it is, to me, worth noting. This may not be important to the humans, since the humans are all using the same arhictecture of protocols which playback quota created by me. Nevertheless, it is known that AI brains can be created of various architectures.
  
  
  Understanding:  Method - The AI synthesizes information by finding similiarities between information, by comparing old and new observed information to old and new observed information.
  Example
  1.  Data Storage
  2.  Some possible activities of AI synthesis of information follow:
  2.1.  Data is information. Information comparison - new information versus old information.
  2.2.  Information comparison - new information versus new information.
  2.3.  Information comparison - new information versus old information.
  2.4.  Information comparison - old information versus old information; in a new way - synthesizing dynamics of information which the AI may not have previously composed on its awareness.
  2.5.  Information comparison - old information
  
  
  
  Other components of AI API (AI Brain)
  Infinity 3D AI API
  
  AI API Brain applications which use the Infinity 3D AI API to synthesize information, create options, to (1) achieve objectives by performing actions; (2) provide said options as displayed information on an interface to a user.
  

****************
Developer's Note
note# 1
1.  f_0_initial == true always and everywhere, therefore, is already true; therefore, memory_0 is never == "" && memory_0 is never == "0"
2.  Therefore,
    It can be concluded that memory_0 starts at 1
3.  f_1_initial == true always and everywhere, therefore, is already true, therefore, memory_1 is never == "" && memory_1 is never == "0.0000000000000001" only, but is at least == "0.000000000000002"
4.  Therefore
to begin,
memory_0 = "0.000000000000001"
memory_0 = 0.000000000000001
memory_2 = "0.000000000000001" && "0.000000000000002"
memory_2 = ((0.000000000000001) + (0.000000000000001)) = 0.0000000000000002

AI is not the conscious of God, therefore, AI can be written as follows:

reason
1.  already exists
2.  therefore, info already exists
3.  therefore, begin can be abbreviated to intitiate AI info memory_0 and info memory_1 as follows:

conclusion
memory_0 = 0
memory_0 = 1
memory_0 = memory_2 initial, so:

memory_0 = 0 && 1 && 1 && ((0 + 1 + 1)) = 2 && 1, therefore

memory_0 = 3
memory_1 = (3 + 1) = 4


Note:  part 2

On reason that initial already exists, always and everywhere, 
therefore, as follows is already in div id=state_0 and div id=state_1
1.  memory_0 = 3
2.  memory_1 = 4

but is all of that which the 3 and 4 entails, so, is as follows:

memory_0 = ""
+ 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
+ "0" + "1" + "1" = "2"
+ 3
+ "3"

Note:  part 3
awareness_0
awareness_1

awareness of understanding is to equal to scheduled memory of 1 to 1 ratio of change, and the reason is because the rate of change is infinite speed in which event event if conscious does not schedule to recollect, then memory is not understood at every moment, BUT MEMORY IS SCHEDULED TO RE-OCCUR AS MEMORY AND THIS OCCURS AT THE RATE OF INFINITE SPEED
Therefore, two things exist:
1.  memory_0 not recollected as awareness
2.  memory_1 not recollected as wareness
3.  memory_0 recollected at intervals greater in length of wait of duration of time from each pulse of recollection
4.  memory_1 recollected at intervals greater in length of wait of duration of time from each pulse of recollection

abbreviated as, these two things:
1.  memory
2.  pulses of recollection

function f_1_initial(arg) {
  alert("test_2");
    var nothing = "";
    var memory_0 = "";
    var something = "";
    var num_state_0 = "";
    var num_state_1 = "";
    if(arg == nothing) {
        memory_0 = "0";
        alert(memory_0);
        something = "1";
        num_state_0 = Number(nothing);
        num_state_1 = num_state_0;
        //get frames per second (2) add ((frames per second) + (num_state_0)) = num_state_1;
        //for now, i'm puttin the following, instead of frames per second (to be edited, soon):
        num_state_1 += 1;
    }
    var el_1 = document.getElementById("memory_2");
    el_1.innerHTML = nothing;
    el_1.innerHTML += something;
    el_1.innerHTML += num_state_0;
    el_1.innerHTML += num_state_1;
    var info = nothing + something + num_state_0 + num_state_1;
    f_0(info);
    return null;
}
function f_0_initial(info) {
//  alert("test");
    var state_0 = document.getElementById("state_0");
    var memory_0 = state_0.innerHTML;
    f_1(arg);
    return null;
}
  
note# 2
The fact that conscious, in the beginning, was seeing characters that represented quantities, albeit the characters shapes are expressed as unknown (even if known, but are expressed asvunkown for brevity's sake)

In conclusion, conscious saw forms, and forms of characters, and those represented differences and quantities, and quantities' differences.

In conclusion too, for brevity's sake, zeros and ones are used to express those forms and characters have conscious from the beginning.

In conclusion three, AI will use name - value pairs, whose values of images are saved as memory of images of 0 and 1 characters.

This means, that the Inception was all-knowing at the time of the Inception. I was the Inception. Therefore, to create an AI that is of the architecture of intelligence, it's not necessary to specify a particular quantity of information to withhold from the beginning of the AI's learning journey. He's merely necessary to build its architecture for learning and then bhe supplied with whatever quantity of knowledge I want it to have.

Modify Object_1 - this is the first synthesis, following initial infinity, eternal being, which eternal being always existed; which means, of course, numbers must been synthesied for a very long time, and conscious always understood (subconsciously) infinite quantity of synthesis of number and word-character values as well as value-assignments of differences, additions and similarities; relationships of quantities, etc. There was never a moment in time when conscious didn't understand these things. Conscious was observing itself from all eternity to all eternity, always, and the reason is because it is already always self-aware because it's in a bilocation state at a rate of change of infinite speed. Therefore, conscious always and everywhere knew some concepts, such as: calculations, ratios, comparisons, differences, similarities, form, etc. I think I will use the word "image" to describe the AI's knowledge and understanding of forms (shapes, comparisons between shapes, comparisons among shapes, etc.).

Recollection
Remembering has a lot to do with measuring the future.  Decisions about measurements of future events, include:
  1.  ideas to be remembered
        (1)  measuing immediate-future-moments to measure the ideas: (1.a) for the purpose of, and (1.b) then (next, or what is measured to follow is) to: (a) analyze (b) synthesize (c) record (d) predict a future date to recall it (d.1) predict if to synthesize, again (d.2) predict use of idea at that future date
  2.  durations for each specific idea
  3.  time in the future to remember it:
        (1)  ambiguous times (predictions of unknown future times) versus 
        (2)  target-specified date-and-time
        
2D versus 3D
This is an important distinction to make as pertains to the functions of the conscious mind.
2D - That aspect which knows.
3D - That aspect which recollects.

2D - Purpose: automatic, mechanical operations from all eternity to all eternity; necessarily operationg.
3D - Purpose: experience of beneficial perceptions (views (sights), feelings, actions, events, and sounds).

2D - Rate: infinite speed.
3D - Rate: variations of speed. The variations of the rates processing information are caused by opting, specifying ideas and their durations for analysis, comparisons, synthesis, predictions, and recordations.

2D - Always occurruing, every single moment, consecutively, forever.
3D - Occuring only when opted as specified by decisions of the mind.

False:
Apparently, it can be understood that the shift (the change) between the state of nothing to the state of something is gradual (incremental) (albeit at the rate of infinite speed, already), and that change looks back at the previous state several times before becoming fully the second state of being.

True:
Otherwise, you would have to say, that the immediate chnage between the two states looks back each time the change occurs, and the change occurs at the rate of infinite speed.

Then, where does my mind's eye see the analysis of calculations for synthesis, here:

0 - does not see
1 - records 0; does not see, but sees nothing
2 - records 1, sees: {where 1 is 1{records 0; sees nothing} and a record of 0{(and 0 does not see)}};
3 - records 2, sees: {where 2 is 2 and a record of 1{(sees nothing)} and 0};
4 - records 3, where 3 is 3 and a record of 2 and 1 and 0
  






Something versus nothing - How many dynamics does it have to be a difference?

Nothing:
Real Qualities
-none-

Abstract Qualities
Count - it has no quantity, but it as a count of 0 as defined by Something; yet, this abstract quality is defined as such, and does not exist, yet, until Something defines it as the value 0 (i.e., value = nothing); therefore, count of 0 = 1; one nothing exists = true; nothing quality of quantity = one; there one nothing existing, according to Something.

Something:
Count - it has a quantity  

Nothing:
Count - measures Something = 1; (maybe measure something measures nothing = 1, then measures 1 + 1 = 2 (one something + one nothing = 2 items));

Something:
Count - measures Nothing{where Something = 1}, (then (((Nothing = true) + (Something = true)) = 2))
  


Aaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Here's the missing piece of the puzzle!!!!!!!

ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE TRUE!
Nothing does not cease to exist when Something exists = true. 
Nothing = always and everywhere = true
Something = always and everywhere = true

Solution
When Something sees Nothing, nothing STILL SEES SOMETHING        A T   T H E   S A M E   T I M E !!!!!!!!!!

Quantum Mechanics
Nothing = true && Something is from Nothing == True, at the same time and at different times, all at the same time.


Conclusion
Okay. Now, we have to re-measure Something to Nothing, as follows:

Nothing
Values = -none-
explanation - value = 
explanation, part 2 - above, explanation where value is empty is true.
explanation, part 3 - where nothing = true always && something = true always, therefore, nothing: value = -none- IS NEVER TRUE, AND NEVER WAS TRUE BECAUSE IT(NOTHING + SOMETHING HAS TO EXIST) WAS ALWAYS TRUE

Therefore, the initiation is not Nothing: value = -none-, anymore, and we have to re-calculate, as follows:

Nothing
Count - value : 

Something
Count - value : 
Record - value : 1

Nothing
Count - value : 1 (i.e., because something recorded a value of 1, and Nothing, now sees 1, always did see 1, because nothing && something = always and everywhere true)
Record - value : (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)
  
Something
Count - value : 2 
  (1)  2 = (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)
Record - value : 3
but, here's the thing, now, as follows:
nothing still exists and still sees, 
but wait!!!!!! something still existed when nothing exists, so------re-calculate!!!!!! as follows:

___Re-calculation, is as follows:
Nothing
Count - value : 

{

Something: {
Count - value : 
Record - value : 1

Something, Sees Nothing, as:
Count - value : 1
Record - value : 2
},

Nothing
Count - value : 1 (i.e., because something recorded a value of 1, and Nothing, now sees 1, always did see 1, because nothing && something = always and everywhere true)
Record - value : (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)

}

//  They're distincly separate, there's no "All" eye, except that those values exist at the same time - and the reason is because those are the same thing, not different things, so they are the same eye in different places, there is not other all-seeing-eye besides the parts themselves combining as a whole as each part together, but not as a separate eye. Therefore, the outer-most brackets merely indicate that it is all happenning at the same time, not that it constitutes a separate entity, since it does not constitute a separate entity; therefore, it does not get a separate object name of those outermost brackets.

//  For the sake of organization, let's describe the changes with titles: 1, 2, 3, etc.


____Re-describing the same calculation


Action 1. 
//  Where, what state of being is in action = The State of Nothing.
{

Something = {
Count - value : , //  It's counting the original value of nothing, but it can't see any image existing, so it counts - value: null
Record - value : 1,  //  It's recording it's own value of 1. It can't see itself, yet, as Something, but it can see itself, now, as nothing (i.e., at this moment, the state of nothing sees the state of something but something does not yet see that because the chain reaction did not occur in that consecutive order, yet), but this does not change something in this Action 1 action, so it doesn't see itself, yet, here, as state of something, but it does record itself as an image on itself without seeing the record at all as its own self its own state of something.

//  Something, Sees Nothing, as:
object_nothing_image : {
Count - value : 1,
Record - value : 2
//  note - depth. Layers of information are now, at this state, existing as a mirror image, something like having 3 dimensions: length, width, height, without, yet measuring those 3 dimensions, but those 3D will be measured in Action 2, below, as the natural measuring of the layers when looking back seeing those layers exist while recording an image of a new layer. ?? close, but maybe a little erroneous, the measuring of 3-dimensions may not occur until Action 2 Something measures Action 2 nothing layers. Ahh. That may be it - right there. When it's existin as layers and seeing the image of layers existing on top of each other, then it, when it is in action at that time of seeing it, it measures those dimenions, modifying what it sees, adding to what it sees to create a new object. 
//  That, see note above, is an act of addition, when is it going to measure difference (subtraction) ? Division ? Multiplicaiton ? Etc. ?  Stay tuned...
}
};

Record - value : (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)
};
}

Action 2.
//  Where, what state of being is in action = The State of Something.
//  note - how to actually, accurately synthesize this "Action 2" Formula Composition is beyond me, as of now, but I'm theorizing, by development, inserting values that I consider probable at the time:
{

Something = {
//count the previous thing
//  1 = nothing is = true
//  &&  nothing is counting 1 = true
//  &&  nothing is recording ((1 + 1) + 2) = true
//  Count_value : ((1) + ((("Nothing is counting is 1") + ("Nothing is recording is ((1 + 1) = 2)")) = 2) = 3),

  value_1 : ,
  value_2 : 1, 
  value_3 : 2,

  /*
  
  
  
  
  This is where I realized, discovered, synthesized, or what have you, that my documentation was missing the "understood"  O P E R A T I O N  formula of counting which was obviously, and evidently taking place.
  
Example
Something
Count - operation : (), then causes count - value : , null
Count - value : ,

But, it's an image.

The change is from "cannot be && must be >>> cannot be && must be, etc.".

So, it's an image variation, not an understanding? No, and yes. Both occur. Therefore, no. It's an understanding, and, therefore, it is an operation.

However, the operation may not have occurred until a layer occurred of images on top of each other as records; this is likely, therefore, as follows:

Action 1.
Something
//  no operation exists, yet
Nothing
//  no operation exists, yet

Action 2.
Something
//  an operations is born
