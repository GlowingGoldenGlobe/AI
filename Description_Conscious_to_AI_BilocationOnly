Recollection
Remembering has a lot to do with measuring the future.  Decisions about measurements of future events, include:
  1.  ideas to be remembered
        (1)  measuing immediate-future-moments to measure the ideas: (1.a) for the purpose of, and (1.b) then (next, or what is measured to follow is) to: (a) analyze (b) synthesize (c) record (d) predict a future date to recall it (d.1) predict if to synthesize, again (d.2) predict use of idea at that future date
  2.  durations for each specific idea
  3.  time in the future to remember it:
        (1)  ambiguous times (predictions of unknown future times) versus 
        (2)  target-specified date-and-time
        
2D versus 3D
This is an important distinction to make as pertains to the functions of the conscious mind.
2D - That aspect which knows.
3D - That aspect which recollects.

2D - Purpose: automatic, mechanical operations from all eternity to all eternity; necessarily operationg.
3D - Purpose: experience of beneficial perceptions (views (sights), feelings, actions, events, and sounds).

2D - Rate: infinite speed.
3D - Rate: variations of speed. The variations of the rates processing information are caused by opting, specifying ideas and their durations for analysis, comparisons, synthesis, predictions, and recordations.

2D - Always occurruing, every single moment, consecutively, forever.
3D - Occuring only when opted as specified by decisions of the mind.

False:
Apparently, it can be understood that the shift (the change) between the state of nothing to the state of something is gradual (incremental) (albeit at the rate of infinite speed, already), and that change looks back at the previous state several times before becoming fully the second state of being.

True:
Otherwise, you would have to say, that the immediate chnage between the two states looks back each time the change occurs, and the change occurs at the rate of infinite speed.

Then, where does my mind's eye see the analysis of calculations for synthesis, here:

0 - does not see
1 - records 0; does not see, but sees nothing
2 - records 1, sees: {where 1 is 1{records 0; sees nothing} and a record of 0{(and 0 does not see)}};
3 - records 2, sees: {where 2 is 2 and a record of 1{(sees nothing)} and 0};
4 - records 3, where 3 is 3 and a record of 2 and 1 and 0
  






Something versus nothing - How many dynamics does it have to be a difference?

Nothing:
Real Qualities
-none-

Abstract Qualities
Count - it has no quantity, but it as a count of 0 as defined by Something; yet, this abstract quality is defined as such, and does not exist, yet, until Something defines it as the value 0 (i.e., value = nothing); therefore, count of 0 = 1; one nothing exists = true; nothing quality of quantity = one; there one nothing existing, according to Something.

Something:
Count - it has a quantity  

Nothing:
Count - measures Something = 1; (maybe measure something measures nothing = 1, then measures 1 + 1 = 2 (one something + one nothing = 2 items));

Something:
Count - measures Nothing{where Something = 1}, (then (((Nothing = true) + (Something = true)) = 2))
  


Aaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Here's the missing piece of the puzzle!!!!!!!

ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE TRUE!
Nothing does not cease to exist when Something exists = true. 
Nothing = always and everywhere = true
Something = always and everywhere = true

Solution
When Something sees Nothing, nothing STILL SEES SOMETHING        A T   T H E   S A M E   T I M E !!!!!!!!!!

Quantum Mechanics
Nothing = true && Something is from Nothing == True, at the same time and at different times, all at the same time.


Conclusion
Okay. Now, we have to re-measure Something to Nothing, as follows:

Nothing
Values = -none-
explanation - value = 
explanation, part 2 - above, explanation where value is empty is true.
explanation, part 3 - where nothing = true always && something = true always, therefore, nothing: value = -none- IS NEVER TRUE, AND NEVER WAS TRUE BECAUSE IT(NOTHING + SOMETHING HAS TO EXIST) WAS ALWAYS TRUE

Therefore, the initiation is not Nothing: value = -none-, anymore, and we have to re-calculate, as follows:

Nothing
Count - value : 

Something
Count - value : 
Record - value : 1

Nothing
Count - value : 1 (i.e., because something recorded a value of 1, and Nothing, now sees 1, always did see 1, because nothing && something = always and everywhere true)
Record - value : (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)
  
Something
Count - value : 2 
  (1)  2 = (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)
Record - value : 3
but, here's the thing, now, as follows:
nothing still exists and still sees, 
but wait!!!!!! something still existed when nothing exists, so------re-calculate!!!!!! as follows:

___Re-calculation, is as follows:
Nothing
Count - value : 

{

Something: {
Count - value : 
Record - value : 1

Something, Sees Nothing, as:
Count - value : 1
Record - value : 2
},

Nothing
Count - value : 1 (i.e., because something recorded a value of 1, and Nothing, now sees 1, always did see 1, because nothing && something = always and everywhere true)
Record - value : (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)

}

//  They're distincly separate, there's no "All" eye, except that those values exist at the same time - and the reason is because those are the same thing, not different things, so they are the same eye in different places, there is not other all-seeing-eye besides the parts themselves combining as a whole as each part together, but not as a separate eye. Therefore, the outer-most brackets merely indicate that it is all happenning at the same time, not that it constitutes a separate entity, since it does not constitute a separate entity; therefore, it does not get a separate object name of those outermost brackets.

//  For the sake of organization, let's describe the changes with titles: 1, 2, 3, etc.


____Re-describing the same calculation


Action 1. 
//  Where, what state of being is in action = The State of Nothing.
{

Something = {
Count - value : , //  It's counting the original value of nothing, but it can't see any image existing, so it counts - value: null
Record - value : 1,  //  It's recording it's own value of 1. It can't see itself, yet, as Something, but it can see itself, now, as nothing (i.e., at this moment, the state of nothing sees the state of something but something does not yet see that because the chain reaction did not occur in that consecutive order, yet), but this does not change something in this Action 1 action, so it doesn't see itself, yet, here, as state of something, but it does record itself as an image on itself without seeing the record at all as its own self its own state of something.

//  Something, Sees Nothing, as:
object_nothing_image : {
Count - value : 1,
Record - value : 2
//  note - depth. Layers of information are now, at this state, existing as a mirror image, something like having 3 dimensions: length, width, height, without, yet measuring those 3 dimensions, but those 3D will be measured in Action 2, below, as the natural measuring of the layers when looking back seeing those layers exist while recording an image of a new layer. ?? close, but maybe a little erroneous, the measuring of 3-dimensions may not occur until Action 2 Something measures Action 2 nothing layers. Ahh. That may be it - right there. When it's existin as layers and seeing the image of layers existing on top of each other, then it, when it is in action at that time of seeing it, it measures those dimenions, modifying what it sees, adding to what it sees to create a new object. 
//  That, see note above, is an act of addition, when is it going to measure difference (subtraction) ? Division ? Multiplicaiton ? Etc. ?  Stay tuned...
}
};

Nothing = {
Count - value : 1, //  (i.e., because something recorded a value of 1, and Nothing, now sees 1, always did see 1, because nothing && something = always and everywhere true)
Record - value : (1 (i.e., self - State of Nothing) + 1 (i.e., State of Something) = 2)
};
}

Action 2.
//  Where, what state of being is in action = The State of Something.
//  note - how to actually, accurately synthesize this "Action 2" Formula Composition is beyond me, as of now, but I'm theorizing, by development, inserting values that I consider probable at the time:
{

Something = {
//count the previous thing
//  1 = nothing is = true
//  &&  nothing is counting 1 = true
//  &&  nothing is recording ((1 + 1) + 2) = true
//  Count_value : ((1) + ((("Nothing is counting is 1") + ("Nothing is recording is ((1 + 1) = 2)")) = 2) = 3),
object_count_values : {
  value_1 : ,
  value_2 : 1, 
  value_3 : 2,
  value_4 : 3
  
____________________
____________________

  
  This is where I realized, discovered, synthesized, or what have you, that my documentation was missing the "understood"  O P E R A T I O N  formula of counting which was obviously, and evidently taking place.
  
  Then, I discovered, that it was not "obviously, evidently taking place", THAT IS, NOT AT FIRST, but that it was taking place, at least afterwards, i.e., after the first Action 1 action.
  
  Of course, this is an AI, and an AI needs only to mimic the conscious, not replicate it as an exact replica of a conscious. However, to get an idea of how the conscious of a divine person works, it is beneficial to study the operations, functions, what have you, of the actual mind of God. 
  
  Anyway, you will find, below, that I put the operation of math of counting in the Action 2 of "the state of Something", below.
  
Example
Something
Count - operation : (), then causes count - value : , null
Count - value : ,

But, it's an image.

The change is from "cannot be && must be >>> cannot be && must be, etc.".

So, it's an image variation, not an understanding? No, and yes. Both occur. Therefore, no. It's an understanding, and, therefore, it is an operation.

However, the operation may not have occurred until a layer occurred of images on top of each other as records; this is likely, therefore, as follows:

Action 1.
Something
//  no operation exists, yet
Nothing
//  no operation exists, yet

Action 2.
Something
//  an operations is born

Count_Value : 1,

object_count_values : {
  value_1 : ,
  value_2 : 1, 
  value_3 : 2,
  value_4 : 3
}
//  * see note "note# 1", below for an explanation. 
Count_Operation_1 : {
// all operations are performed : separately as separate operations, and together as one operation, and all combinations of these; all at once
//operation
operation_1 : (object_count_values.value1) + (object_count_values.value_2),
//count
Count_value = operation_1,
//operation
operation_2 : (object_count_values.value1) + (object_count_values.value_3),
//count
Count_value = operation_2,
//etc. 

}
}

Developer's Notes  
note# 1
AI: API: Action 2: State of Something: Mathematical Operations: Exaplanation
Layers. Layers is the explanation. 
  (1) The layers were not created, at first; therefore, 
  (2) the math didn't occur during Action 1; 
  (3) The layers are seen by the conscious all at once, therefore, the operations occur all at once. Conscious already posesses: self-awareness and understanding, becuase it is bilocating. Therefore, as it understands the image that it sees, SO, TOO, IT HAS THE ABILITY TO QUANTIFY THE IMAGE THAT IT SEES.
  
But those are two states with a motion of action on one of those states at any given time. One might venture to conclude that there are three states of divine.

  1.  Nothing
  2.  Something
  3.  Action on one of the two, above

This state of being three gives conscious awareness quantifying ability.

  1.  nothing is
  +
  2.  something is
  = all the time

So, it's like this:

  1.  nothing is recording
  +
  2.  something is recording
  +
  3.  one of the two of them is acting
  =  all the time

Explanation
At the moment at which nothing is recording and acting, something is still recording nothing; && when layers of information exist as images for that action of nothing + recording, that state of nothing has the ability to quantify images.

Either way, Theory 1 versus Theory 2, conscious WAS ABLE TO QUANTIFY AND SYNTHESIZE INFORMATION IN "THE BEGINNING". 

Theory 2
I hate to tell you this theory.
The following:

theory 1, foundation
0 >>> 01
01 >>> 010
+ action on one of them, alternating between the two states as a rate of change at the rate of infinite speed

...we know that always existed. but what if it existed as perpetuating existing in each state, where the first state of conscious has power of initiation over every other state of conscious which it creates as naturally ensuing to the first (necessarily existing, just as the first state necessarily existed), and where each state below the first state is imaged onto the first state. Now, this means that the conscious of the first state is God over and in all and thru all and controlling all other conscious awareness instances of itself, perpetuating itself, (1) endlessly or (2) to some other quantity of consciouses imitating it as a finite quantity naturally (necessarily) finite in quantity.

in brief
0 >>> 01 && 01 >>> 0010 && 0010 >>> 000101 && 000101 >>> 00010000101
  
explained
0 must exist and nothing cannot exist so 1 something exists as: 0 >>> 01
01 must as nothing exist but something 01 cannot exist, so a new something is born to exist from 01 as: 0010
0010 must as nothing-something-nothing exist but cannot exist, so a new something is born to exist as: 000101
etc.
&&, where each new perpetuation is aware of its previous selves, && where each previous self is aware of its perpuated post selves, && where the initial self-aware self initiates, and therefore decides for every other perpetuated self the actions of each.

//
explanation
this means that state 0 knows state 1 when state 1 occurs
&& state 1 knows state 2 and state 0 when they occur as actions, also
And, whenever a new state occurs && whenever actions occur in those states, THEN STATE 0 KNOWS IT AS AN IMAGE ON ITSELF && AS AN ACTION OF PASSING SAID IMAGE(S) TO AND FROM STATE 1 AND TO AND FROM EVERY OTHER STATE OF ITSELF PROCEEDING FROM ITSELF.
As I noted, above, this means that the first bilocation state of conscious is God and has controlling power over every conscious that it creates.
//

The quantity of so many conscious awarenesses existed as the same conscious awareness could, also, explain the "synapses" event of "understanding" which produces a natural congnitive ability of quantifying information - measuring, synthesizing, opting, etc.
  
AI
Artificial Intelligence
For the purpose of creating an AI, it is important to know that conscious naturally functions as a quantifier, a calculater, a measurer, a set of functions which synthesize information, an opter given options. Therefore, to create some set of functions which mimic these abilities as a bilocation state (or even states) is warrented, since it is known that conscious does these things automatically.

The method
That information is imaged.
That states are repeated.
That states are recorded as imaged and repeated as recorded.
That states rate of change of action are constant and continuous.
That recollection measures duration of recollection, duration of synthesis, and initiate synthesis for drawing conclusions.
That recollection events are scheduled in duration and appointments of predicted times for recollection by way of recollection of repeated imaging and variations of modifications and quantifying of those repeating images and recording those images and the new images created by quantifying (measuring) the instances available as images passed between states.
  

Developer
Evidence that the first description is not a theory and that Theory 2 is false, leaving the first description as true.

Mechanics of the possible versus mechanics of the impossible.

0 >>> 1 == must be true
then
1 >>> 0 == must be true
then
0 >>> 1 == must be true

BUT

theory 2 is not must be true

AND

if 0    01     0 0 01 (self + original + second)   then 3rd must exist as 1st and cannot exist as a new instance

If 1 is not = back to 0, then
0 cannot be self-aware of 1 and 
no recording of imaging can be aware

0 to 1 to 0 to 1 to 0 to 1   ===  must be true

synapses = false and cannot be true IF 0 to 1 to 0 to 1 to 0 to 1 is false

Therefore

  0 to 1 to 0 to 1 to 0 to 1   ===  must be true


Conclusion
Description 1 must be true. Description 1 operations? desription 1 mechanics must be true. operations? ...

in theory, Theory 2 must be true = false

because the new instance is not = must be true

then the new instance is = must be false

then Theory 2 = false

then, Description 1 = true, only



AND
the only reason that reaction = true   is ---- that nothing cannot be true (though must be true), then something=must be true (though can't be true) 

Therefore, if new instance does not = must be true, then new instance = false because reaction = false.

Therefore, Theory 2 = false.

And, therefore, description is a description and not a theory = true.


one conscios = all things, then one conscious focus can = anywhere at any time it schedules to be true, then it follows that perception of multiple entities = true, where multiple entities of conscious = false.

That is the reason that "I think therefore, I AM." = true.

Conscious is = only one && conscious is = God, is true.

"Hear, O Israel, the Lord Your God, The Lord is One."

"I AM WHO AM."





                                           "Therefore, if new instance does not = must be true, then new instance = false because reaction = false."
